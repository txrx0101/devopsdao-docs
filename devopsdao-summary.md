# What is dodao.dev?

Dodao.dev is a decentralized uniform platform for quality software development and design
work, a decentralized marketplace for developers and designers. We are building the app as a
multi-platform dApp, it is currently available on Android and web, it will also be available on
iOS, MacOS, Microsoft and LINUX. We would like the people use our dApp on their
preferred platform, we do not want to create any boundaries. We believe future dApps must
be multi-chain and multi-platform. We have recently launched our own Dodao AppChain on Tanssi Network.

The dodao.dev is built to support multiple chains. Withdrawal of funds is already available to
Ethereum, Fantom, Moonbeam, Avalanche, Polygon, Fantom Sonic Testnet while we add more chains to
withdrawals, we are also working on deploying our contract to the mentioned chains so
dodao.dev will be available on the native blockchain as well.

Because of our multi chain focus dodao.dev will be available to a much larger community
than an dApp on only one chain. We believe in the future of multi chain dApps, and cross
chain transactions. We believe that cross-chain transactions will help the adoption of this
innovative technology.

# What makes dodao.dev unique?

Dodao.dev is being built with the developers and designers as a center piece. We are building
dodao.dev with the community in mind, the DAO will be owned and governed by the
community.

Our solution is a decentralized solution, totally different than the centralized competition. Our
dApp served from permaweb at its alpha release will gradually remove the intermediary from
all processes and will replace any overhead that has no direct contribution to value creation
through technology.

Every user participating in the DAO will own a unique NFT that displays their role within the
DAO, their technical skills, their skills’s level, their work experience and their efficiency in
completing the tasks will be updated and displayed on their NFT. A developer profile will
only consist of on-chain metrics data of actual work done. Users do not need to stake any of
their NFTs, or any of their token, it is enough to keep the NFTs in their wallets. We encourage
everyone in the crypto space to “self-custody”.

In fact dodao.dev will be a platform to which the user can plug into to receive services
offered by dodao.dev; we do not make it mandatory to use dodao.dev at all, dodao.dev is not
restrictive, but inclusive. More general communication could take place using any tool the teams prefer.
Specific, relevant information can be stored using the built-in chat function on dodao.dev. 

Yes, it is true, we have built chat in dodao.dev. After two users agree to work together, "chat" is enabled 
and the two users can chat with each other witin the task itself, which gives possibility to store specific 
and relevant information to be stored into the task, this data could later be used in other processes.

# Who are the people behind dodao.dev?

First of all we are people who believe in that technology should be used for the good of
humanity. We are a small group of tech professionals, designers and project managers, who
have spent decades in web2, now moving into web3, and aiming to build the first true
decentralized marketplace for professional tech/design work. We have built many applications
for many enterprises, we will build devopsdao, this time we are building for the people. It is
as simple as this.

Our code is open source, we welcome pull requests on our GITHUB

# What technologies devopsdao created and used?

Devopsdao itself is a technology company, being built and run by developers, project
managers who are already participating in the technology market since more than 20 years,
accumulated a wealth of knowledge and experience in the freelance tech market. We are
pouring in all our knowledge and experience into our product.

We are building a custom designed platform for Android/iOS, Microsoft/MacOS/Linux and
Web/Desktop where users will be able to get small jobs done, hire developers for a more
complex and sophisticated product development with fixed terms and sprints planning.

Devopsdao dApp is built on Flutter 3 powered by Dart language. Framework optimized for
fast native apps on any platform. Devopsdao is a early bird blockchain project based on
Flutter 3, taking the advantage to be presented on major platforms. Devopsdao EIP-2539
based smart contract Diamonds are compiled with hardhat and depend on Axelar GMP SDK
for cross-chain interoperability. Devopsdao web app is served from Arweave decentralized
cloud.

# Technology used and implemented

Arweave, Axelar, Dart2, Flutter3, Moonbeam,
Solidity, Walletconnect, Ethereum EIP-2535 Diamonds, EIP-1155 multi token contracts.
